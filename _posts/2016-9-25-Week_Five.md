title: Week Five!

### What did you do this past week?
Career Fiair!!! It was pretty great to go to the career fair and talk with recruiters about internships for the summer. As always, a lot of great
 companies were there and I hope that I'm able to secure an internship. This past week we also wrapped up Project 2 and my partner and I feel
 pretty solid about. There were a few tricky parts about getting the class provided caches to work with Travis but we managed to get it working
 and passing on TravisCI. I got 6 out of a 100 points taken off on my Project 1 because I didn't do the documentation of my functions properly so I made sure we
 did it right this time around.
### What is in your way?
I feel like at this point I've gotten fairly comfortable with all the different analytical tools that we are required to use for this class and so
 they are no longer the main thing in my way. At the moment, there isn't really anything in my way that I can think of. I just need to make sure that I set aside 
enough time to properly study for the upcoming exam and ace it.
### What will you do next week?
This coming week is going to be full of studying for the exam that is in two Thursdays.
### Tip-of-the-week
As always, NASA is awesome and has created an inflatable module for the International Space Station. I can't help but think of an inflatable bounce house
 in space that can help shield astronauts from micrometeorites and radiation. This tech is still in its developmental stage and lots of tests
 are being done to help assess its viability for things like long-term voyages to Mars and beyond. Here's a link to a video where astronauts entered the module
 for the first time to gather sensor data: http://www.space.com/33087-astronauts-enter-inflatable-space-station-habitat.html
