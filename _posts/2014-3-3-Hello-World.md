### What did you do this past week?

Well this past week marked the end of my summer and the return to the grind with the start of the new semester. It was a pretty short week since classes started on a Wednesday but dispite that, after Professor Downing whent over your typical class intro, he wasted no time in getting the ball rolling with this class. A large portion of the class time was spent going over some of the tools that we will be making use of to help analysis and write our code. The rest of the class time was spent going over the basic question of, what is object oriented programming?

### What is in your way?

The main challenges that I have come across thus far is learning how to use some of the analytical and enviromental tools that Professor Downing would like for us to use, such as Docker and Google Test. However with sufficient time, learning how to use these tools shouldn't be a problem. They are well documented and easy to read.

### What will you do next week?

Next week I will continue to go over the documentation for all of the tools as well as brush up on my C++. I started to learn the language over the summer while doing a little project for my dad so I am not going into this class cold. It's not a hard language to pick up especially if you have prior knowledge about how OOP works through programming in Java and about low-level memory management like in C.

Overall, I can see this class easily being my hardest class for the semester. Based on the student reviews of the class and the estimated hours of reading and coding that will need to be done each week to ensure success in the class, it seems like it will be tough but at the same time the student reviews of Professor Downing were pretty positive. They conveyed that he not only he has a thorough understand of the material but also that he does a good job of explaining the material and based on my first inpressions, I find those reviews to be pretty accurate.
