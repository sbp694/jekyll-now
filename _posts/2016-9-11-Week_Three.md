title: Week Three!
---

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we turned in project one and I feel pretty solid about it. I haven't received an email from the graders saying that I broke the grading script so, yay! Overall I thought it was a good assignment, but one issue I had with it was that it was not very clear as to what was given to us in the provided code and what we needed to write ourselves (other than the optimized collatz algorithm portion obviously). Maybe this was just on me and I miss something said in class, but when going over the rubric, there were other things that needed to be included such as a Doxygen file and a valgrind analysis as well as some other reports on the efficiency of our programs. Not knowing how to run these checks I took to Piazza and Google to see if there was any talk about them amongst other students and to look up some documentation on how to use them. However, later I came to realize that the checks had already been written into the provided makefile and I didn’t need to worry about them. Other than that, I feel that the project was good and it helped me get used to some of the different tools we will be using throughout the class.
### What is in your way?
I’d have to say that the main things that are in my way are still all the different analytical tools. Before this class I had never used valgrind to analyze my memory usage or gcov to look at how efficiently I am using my code. That being said I am making progress! As I said before project one has helped me get familiar with them and I believe the subsequent projects will do the same.

### What will you do next week?
This coming week I will begin project 2! Doctor Downing hasn’t posted anything about it yet so I have no idea what to expect but I will be sure to get right to work on it as soon as it is available. 

### Tip-of-the-week
I just thought that this was a pretty cool article regarding the developement of autonomous cars, enjoy!
