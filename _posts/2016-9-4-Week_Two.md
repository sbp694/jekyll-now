title: Week Two!
---

### What did you do this past week?
We received our first programming assignment this week and while the problem we have to solve isn't very hard, I believe the main purpose of the assignment is to acclimate us with all the tools we are to use for testing and analyzing our code on this project as well as future assignments. Also during the lectures this week we went over various topics such as Error message passing through try-catch blocks and different optimizations for the current assignment we're working on.

### What is in your way?
At the moment I am still getting use to all the new tools we have to use, such as TravisCI, but as I mentioned in my previous post the tools are well documented, so learning how to use isn't too hard. Plus there is this amazing thing called YouTube! I have watched many tutorials on how to do various things during my time in college and have learned a good deal though them.

### What will you do next week?
Next week we wrap up our first project and start the next one! The College of Natural Science's career fair is also coming up in the next couple of weeks so I will be making sure my resume is up to snuff so I can try and snag one of those all-important internships for the next summer.

### Tip-of-the-week
For those of you who are looking into also adding some business experience to your computer science degree, I suggest looking into getting your PMP Certification (Project Management Professional). I'm not too familiar with what all is involved in getting certified but I have had multiple friends who are already very much established in their careers (some computer science) suggest looking into getting. Personally, I can see myself going into management so on-top of my computer science degree I am also getting my Business Foundations Certificate and I know for a fact that a number of CS people are also pursuing the Foundations Certificate.
