title: Week Four!

### What did you do this past week?
This past week I mainly worked on project 2 with my partner and it is nearing completion.

### What is in your way?
At this point, I have to say that the main thing that is in my way is my lack of knowledge of the C++ standard libraries. Going
into this class I didn't know much C++ and had only done a little bit of programming using that language so my knowledge of it is still fairly limited.
Completing the past couple of projects has made me more aware of some functions and classes that are available in the C++ libraries and has made
writing some code much easier. However I still have much to learn.

### What will you do next week?
This Tuesday is the College of Natural Science's career fair and so I will be attending that
and doing my best to snag an internship for the following summer. With this week comes the due date for
project two, so my partner and I will be wrapping that up shortly.

### Pick-of-the-week
I grew up in an environment where NASA and space were very much involved in my life
and so I have a strong passion for space exploration. I try to stay up to date with 
some of the latest developments and while talking to Dr. Downing this week about his time at
JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), he told me about how developers are trying to create
a virtual reality simulator for Facebookâ€™s Hololens that would allow scientist to "walk" 
on the surface of Mars and I just thought that really interesting. I encourage you to check it out!
