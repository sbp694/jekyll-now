### What did you do this past week?

This past week we had our first exam! Overall I felt prepared for the exam; however, I got stuck on the hardest problem and by the time I figured out how to do it, I didn't have time to fully implement my answer. If you're reading this and you plan on or are currently taking this class, don't be like me and think that the testing peroid is 2 hours rather than an hour and a half. Double check how much time you have to take the exam before you start. Dr. Downing gave us a list of topics that he recommended that we go over in order to preapre for the exam and atfer going over them thoroughly, I felt pretty prepared for the exam.

### What is in your way?

In regard to the my overall grade, I may have ruined my chances of getting an A in the class with my performance on the first exam. I didn't quite finish because I took too long trying to figure out how to do the hardest problem. I also thought I had 2 hours to take the exam rather than just an hour and a half so I didn't quite move as quickly as I should have.

### What will you do next week?

This coming week we will start project 3 which is over building an allocator and managing the heap.

### Pick-of-the-week

I have come across a surprising number of people that have thought that NASA pretty much "ended" or at least haven't done anything ever since the space shuttles were retired. Here's one of their major projects that they have been working on!
