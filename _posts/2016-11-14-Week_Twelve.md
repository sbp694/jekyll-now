### What did you do this past week?
Overall last week wasn’t very eventful.  We mainly just had the fifth and final project to work on which is due this week. I had heard rumors that the final project for this class was going to be considerably harder and would take longer to complete than all the others but personally, I have not found this to be true. The size of the assignment is just about as big all the others and it doesn’t seem especially difficult so maybe these rumors that I have heard were more applicable to previous semesters.
### What is in your way?
I can’t really say that there is anything in my way at the moment. My partner and I are making steady progress on the final project and should have it done on time. We have yet to run into any major speed bumps and we feel like we have a firm enough understanding of the class material to complete the assignment properly.
### What will you do next week?
Mainly just wrapping up the final project and then I will start preparing for the last midterm.
### Pick-of-the-week
A couple weeks ago I saw on a social media articles talking about a concept motorcycle that BMW is working on that is supposed to be so “safe”, that you would not need a helmet. As someone who has been regularly commuting to school and other places around town on a moped for over a year now and is at least somewhat aware of the many dangers involved in riding such a vehicle, I don’t care how much coding a bike has, it is never ok to advocate not wearing a helmet while riding on the streets. Don’t be a squid, wear the proper gear. Ride safe!
