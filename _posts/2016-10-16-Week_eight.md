title: Week Eight!
---

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we started project three! We spent the majority of the time in lecture talking about the underlying concepts regarding allocators, which is what project 3 is over. Essentially what we are doing for this assignment is creating a simple allocator for the heap. Based on first impressions, it doesn't seem too difficult, mainly just tedious.

### What is in your way?
There isn’t really anything major that is in my way at the moment. Though I guess the biggest challenge that I will face this coming week will be making sure that all possible scenarios for how the code in project 3 can be used are covered with the unit tests. Making sure that the “valid” function properly checks the status of the heap allocation and deallocation will be crucial for ensuring that the rest of the project works properly.

### What will you do next week?
This coming week will mainly consist of finishing project 3 by Thursday and my continued pursuit a computer science internship.

### Pick-of-the-week
Here’s just a little snippet of news regarding the commercial space company, Orbit. This is the first major launch for Orbital since their big accident almost two years ago. For those of you who don’t know what I am talking about, two-ish years ago the an Orbital Antares rocket that was tasked with delivering routine supplies, among other things such as a cube satellite from UT, to the international space station exploded just moments after clearing the launch pad and came crashing back down to the ground. Just goes to show that well… rocket science is hard.
