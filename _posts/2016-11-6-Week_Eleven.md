title: Week Eleven!

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we turned in project 4: Darwin. Overall I think that my partner and I did well and that we will get a good score on the project. I'm not sure if other people had as much trouble as me but throughout a good portion of the assignment I was a bit confused as to what was considered a getter or a setter. To me, what defined a getter and a setter was pretty vague. That being said, with the help of the TA’s my partner and I were able to check to see if we were doing it right.
### What is in your way?
At the moment, I wouldn't really say that there is anything in my way. Though one thing that I need to make sure happens before starting to code my solution for project 5, is going to office hours and making sure that I fully understand what is being asked of me in this assignment. That seems like the obvious thing to do but I unfortunately started the previous project without a proper understanding of some key requirements which resulted in it taking longer than it should have.
### What will you do next week?
This coming week I will be starting project 5 which is programming the Game of Life.
### Pick-of-the-week
It is interesting to thing about how computers at their very foundation consist of nothing but 1s and 0s, on and off. Mankind used its intellect to create machines based on that simple concept to aid in everyday life and now they are becoming so complex that they are able to “think for themselves” so to speak.
